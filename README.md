# QR Code Generator in Rust

The goal of this project is to show an implementation of a QR code generator in Rust.

This project won't be uploaded to the Cargo directory because there are better implementations that exist. This was merely a personal project for me to learn Rust.

This implementation primarily used [Massimo Artizzu's QR code tutorial](https://dev.to/maxart2501/let-s-develop-a-qr-code-generator-part-i-basic-concepts-510a), but also referenced [Thonky's QR code tutorial](https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/).
